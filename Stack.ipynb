All elements in a class default to public.\n",

    "A memory leak occurs when memory is allocated by a program and then _never_ released back to the operating system.  This leaked (unreleased) memory, if the leak (or leaks) is occurs repeatedly, can cause a program or even the computer to crash when the available memory is used up.\n",

    "A leak typically occurs when memory is allocated to a pointer or object and that pointer or object is lost without the allocated memory first being released.  A couple examples of reasons that a pointer or object can be lost are:\n",
    "1. If the allocated memory is assigned to a pointer on the local stack of a function, and then the program exits that function (which causes that pointer to be lost) without releasing the memory.  Since the pointer (or handle) to the allocated memory has now been lost, the program cannot ever free the allocated memory, since the program doesn't know where it is.\n",
    "1. If the allocated memory is assigned to a pointer variable, and then that pointer variable gets overwritten without the allocated memory being released.  Once the memory pointer is overwritten, the reference (or handle) to the allocated is lost and cannot be recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in most operating systems, when a program is terminated, the operating system is able to recover all of the leaked memory, as the operating system's memory management does keep track of all memory allocated by a particular program while that program is executing.  Once the program ceases execution, the memory management system reclaims any memory allocated to that program."
